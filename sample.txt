    This article is about earthquakes and building houses about them. 
There was an earthquake in Haiti with a magnitude of 7.0 which can be considered a major earthquake. 
These types of earthquakes wreak havoc on buildings and as a result, people are injured or killed. 
They are obviously very lethal so people had to step up and make a change. 
It turns out that the people that were trying to make change were just young teenagers that were very concerned. 
Ashton Cofer, Julie Bray, and Luke Clay were those three people that looked into this predicament. 
They wanted to design plans for housing and buildings that would be more resistant to earthquakes. 
They took inspiration from the shape of pringles. It turns out that the shape of pringles has been scientifically 
designed in order to maintain structural integrity. The shape of pringles is similar to the shape of nuclear cooling towers. 
The reasoning for this is because of earthquakes. This shape is able to resist seismic waves caused by earthquakes. This is 
important because you obviously donâ€™t want something like a nuclear plant being susceptible to earthquakes. They designed 
houses that were built out of materials that were cheap yet strong and flexible. When you combine the material with the 
shape, the houses are now pretty resistant to earthquakes. 
    
    This relates to physics because of the discussion of forces. Forces are mentioned when talking about the materials 
that are used for buildings, specifically concrete. We know that f = ma, so if you increase the mass, then the 
total force increases. Concrete has more mass than bamboo so it is incredibly dangerous if a concrete building collapses. 
People are in danger when they are in concrete buildings. Besides, the way that concrete buildings were designed were 
not efficient when it came to resisting seismic waves.
